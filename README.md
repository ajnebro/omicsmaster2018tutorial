# Tutorial: "Multi-objecive optimization with metaheuristics. Applications to multiple sequence alignment and other bioinformatics problems"

This site contains stuff to be used in the tutorial I will give in the Omics Data Analysis Master of the University of Vic on 7th February 2018.

In this tutorial we will learn:

* What are metaheuristic techniques and why they are useful.
* Issues related to optimizing problems having more tan one objective function (multi-objective optimization problems).
* How to use the [jMetal optimization framework](http://jmetal.github.io/jMetal/) to solve both single and multi-objective optimization problems.
* To apply the [M2Align](https://github.com/KhaosResearch/M2Align) metaheuristic to deal with multi-objective formulations of the multiple sequence alignment problem.
